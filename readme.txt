WHAT CONTENT WILL PRIZMA DISPLAY? 

Prizma for WordPress curates both content from throughout the Prizma Syndication Network—a hand-curated group of sites that produce quality, brand-aligned content—your own video inventory, or both, ensuring the right content is showed to the right person at the right time. You can specify what types of content belong on your site at dashboard.prizma.ai (but our recommendation engine is best-in-class, we swear!).

WILL PRIZMA CHANGE HOW MY SITE LOOKS?

Nope! Well, not other than the fact that the Prizma for WordPress plugin is adding a bunch of curated video content to it. The plugin auto-learns your site\'s CSS and tries to match it by default. Of course, you can also specify a stylesheet the plugin should use to fully control the experience.
